Hi, I'm %%name%% and I am able to do lots of things including:
- Converting audio and videos to voice- and video notes
- Converting YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud and MixCloud songs to MP3
- Downloading videos off YouTube, Vimeo, Pornhub etc.
- Managing your group with kick, delete and ban commands
- Saving messages to send them later on; kinda like stickers (Extras)
- Making group chats a little more fun with counters, that count how many times specific things are being said

Use /stats to see what you can and can't do with the bot as some modules might be deactivated.

All that is modular and open to anybody.
